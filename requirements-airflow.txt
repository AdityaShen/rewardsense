# Airflow-specific dependencies (subset of main requirements.txt)
# Keep this lean - only what DAGs actually need at runtime
#
# NOTE: Do NOT pin sqlalchemy here. Airflow 2.8.x requires sqlalchemy<2.0
# and the base image already includes a compatible version.
# NOTE: DVC is not included here. DAGs that need DVC should use
# BashOperator to call the DVC CLI, which runs on the host or
# in a separate container.
